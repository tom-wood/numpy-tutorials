# Numpy tutorials for Part II students
Tutorials can be downloaded individually by clicking on them, then in the
top right hand corner right clicking on Raw and selecting Save link as.
Alternatively if you can download a zip file of the entire tutorial set
by clicking the green Clone or download button in the top right of this
page. Work through them. Google is your friend if you don't know how a 
function or a method works. It is normal to throw errors. If you are using
Spyder (IPython) and you would like the plots to come up in a different
window (useful if you want to zoom in), then you will need to put the
line ```%matplotlib qt``` in your code.
